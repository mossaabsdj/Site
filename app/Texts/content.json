The project is based on producing fresh milk from a herd of high-quality dairy cows, which is then transformed into various types of cheese using traditional or semi-industrial methods, such as fresh or aged cheeses. The cheese is made using milking equipment, a pasteurization and curdling unit, and temperature- and humidity-controlled aging rooms. The project focuses on quality, hygiene, and the local character of the product, giving it added value in high-end markets. The cheese is marketed directly at the farm, as well as through shops, hotels, and specialty markets. Regarding sanitary conditions, all health regulations must be respected. This farm specializes in producing natural and artisanal local products using local herbs and oils.",
